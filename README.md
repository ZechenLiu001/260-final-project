Group 9
Zhaoxun Hou, Zechen Liu, Haoyuan Li, Jianyue Guan

Goal of the project:
In our project, we use four different methods to analyze and predict COVID-19 in US all counties.
1. RNN
2. SEIR
3. GLM
4. A Shiny app spatial data to detect potential hotspots of counties and aid finding the counties impacted heavily by COVID-19, and serveas an efficient tool to visualize the data anaylsises.

Instruction:
1. Look at Rmd and html filt `Final report.Rmd`, `Final-report.html`
2. Run our Shiny app `app.R`

Data Files:
1. `LAC_clean.csv`
2. `apple.csv`
3. `processed.csv`
4. `rnn_results.csv`
5. `time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv`
5. `us-counties.csv`
